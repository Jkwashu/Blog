Hello again everyone! Its that time of the week for me to update anyone listening about my progress and week of working in Disco Tray Studios ! This week I worked with my team on the Conway Historical sites project once again, and decided to take on the task of fixing up the Firebase rules! I did this for two reasons, 1. in my previous group I worked on and directly created the firebase rules for my team in our project last semester, and I have had experience in my previous classes with working on a database. All of that being said I underestimated the work that this would take to get set up, I started by creating some basic rules which I implemented during my time in our weekly Disco Tray meeting on Wednesday last week and gave read / write permissions to any visitor for the time being while I worked on what to do with administrator privileges.

To my surprise the administrator page and adminstator in general had little to no functionality built for it at all in the database or in the app. But I did not realize this until after trying to implement my initial administrator rules for the database which caused some issues for a little while this week to say the least. So I quickly got to work and scrapped the rules I was working with and went back to the initial implementation while I built out the foundation and functionality for the administrator in our app. While this took around nearly 5 hours of my life i'll never get back, there is now 500 lines of code that build a (in my honest humble awesome opinion) pretty decent administrator page which will allow for those who actively preside over the app the ability to change and modify (or add/delete) sites from around Faulkner County!

I think in the long run this will be a very helpful addition to the app and allow for much better integration for the eventual owners of the app that may not have the ability or time to hard code a new site or change it every time they need to. I hope to continue working on this and get the full functionality and rules for the database updated soon so that the app can finally begin to stand on its own for users and for the owners of the app! I look forward to updating all of you listening as to how this will go, and will see you all again next week!
