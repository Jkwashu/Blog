Hey Everyone ! This post is an update for the new styling changes to the blog. Admidst this time working on Lab 3 in CSCI 340 I was required to make a few styling changes to the website, all of which I think are very cozy. You might find the addition of a 'Bears' page in which you can see some of my favorite pictures of bears! If you're having trouble finding it here should be the link: [Bears] (https://jkwashu.github.io/Blog/Bears/)

The website is now updated to use Rosario, a font in which I am very fond of but this may be subject to change in the future when I have more time to change things. I've decided after looking at how lonely my github looks at the bottom of my page to add in my linkedIn which you can also click here and follow me: [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-washum-1a5899261/)

As a few final remarks to reflect on this lab, there wasn't exactly anything that felt too new in this lab. For the most part things felt similar and seamless coming directly from lab 2. I did struggle for a little while on trying to figure out colors and fonts that I felt worked well together or generally just looked appealing enough to stay. That being said I am happy with how things turned out. I am looking forward to posting more on this blog and making more of a personal space for me to highlight computer science accomplishments in the future.
