Hey Everyone! Its been a few weeks, but here is an update on what I've been up to in CSCI 340 (Databases and Websystems). This past week we have been familiarizing ourselves with using Vertabelo for SQL, LucidChart, and Trello in preparation for the upcoming final projects that we will be working on. In this lab we were to work wiht Entity Relationship Diagrams using LucidChart as seen below:

and the SQL Schema in Vertabelo:

This lab was one that I particulary was very interesting in learning the skills for, as both my mom and dad work or have worked with Trello and SQL. That being said, I feel as though both the models I created satisfied everything that I could think of. Specifically I enjoy the concise nature of both models and think that they do a good job of representing what the client had asked for in our given scenario. I think that the biggest complication that could be encountered with the current database would be that a user could possibly order without having an account, which could possibly happen through a temporary account made by the user based on check-out information submitted for an order. Additionally there could be issues with substition, as there isn't a direct variable checking for substitution quantity avaliabilty. But nonetheless, this lab was an incredible learning experience and I feel confident using Vertabelo and LucidChart for future projects data models.
