summary: First week at Disco Tray !
---
Hello again everyone ! It sure has been a while since my last post but do not worry I am here to give an update! I have been given the opportunity to work at Disco Tray Studios under Dr. Goadrich this semester!! As part of our weekly work assignments we are to write a post on our blog, so I will be doing that here from here on out during this semester. 

Without further ado, let me tell you all what I have been up to this week. This week being my first I started off working on getting my name and picture posted onto the Disco Tray Studios website. After which myself and my partners Colten Berry and Dylan Carter worked on getting documentation ready over our first assigned project work: The Conway Historical Sites app. This app is made in flutter, which all three of us worked a lot with last semester in the Mobile Software Development class with Dr. Goadrich. After some time figuring out what issues we would need to be working on we met up on Monday to divide out the issues and assign ourselves to what we each felt we were the most equipped for.

The issues that I am working on for the project are: Achievements not being saved to user data, Ratings not working for new users, and a future development which would be incorporating new historical sites! This week however I just worked on specifically addressing the first issue and worked to figure out why new achievements are not being saved to the user data. I created some new methods inside the app_state.dart file which would keep track of whether as user has visited the site to unlock the achievement to now use the application state on the achievements page to update user data whenever a user taps on the achievement.

And it works ! I made my first pull request earlier today for Disco Tray to merge my commits to the main branch so the app can have functional achievements (minus the actual location data part)! So that has been my first week for Disco Tray, I look forward to all projects that I will get to work on and the help that I hope to make for these projects in the time that I have with Disco Tray. If you want to see more, I will continue updating this blog weekly for the semester I am with Disco Tray, and stay tuned!

Until next time!
