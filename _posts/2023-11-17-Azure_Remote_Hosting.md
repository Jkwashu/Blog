Hey everyone! This post is a bit a reflection on the work I did in lab 10. Over the past week me and my team for the final project of CSCI 340 have been working hard in order to get our website ready to deploy to Azure. However in order to do this we first had to learn what exactly needed to be done.
We went ahead and decided that we would work at meetings together and in class during allowed free time to get this lab done. We did the project on Hayden's laptop as it seemed easier to talk through and each of us understand what was happening together rather than split up the work. The hardest aspects that we came across was really the connecting strings we ran into many issues specifically with how they are used as it wasn't exactly how first expected, but we eventually got this part of the tutorial sorted out working in class alongside Dr. Goadrich. On the other hand, we found during our meeting together that creating the app server was the easiest part, as this only required a few clicks and everything worked the first time.
Overall, I think that this was a fun and fairly straighforward lab, as each of us were able to help set up and get the lab working. I believe that each of us, including myself, are confidently prepared to deploy our website when we agree that we are ready.
