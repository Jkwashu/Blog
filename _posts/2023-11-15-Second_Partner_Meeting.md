---
Hi again everyone! This post is a bit of an update as to what I have been working on in regard to my team for the final project of CSCI 340: Faulkner County Juvenile Court. In many ways this meeting was a sigh of relief for me and my group members. We met with our client and was met with nothing but good things about our interpretation of what she asked of us as well as the design of the project itself. While our meeting ran fairly short, we prepared in the days leading up to it by meeting and talking about a few questions to clarify as well as what exactly she would want from us moving forward.

That being said, our client meeting did leave some reorganization up to discussion for the remainder of our project. So from here on our I will be the lead for design, implementing our website to azure, and working with my partner Hayden Moussa in order to establish working creation of graphs and charts for the annual report page for our project. Originally I was anticipated to play more of a role on the javascript of the front end on the website. However, after talking with my team we have decided to split most of the javascript between both me and Hayden and leave design up to myself, as I took a strong design role in our moqups and initial razor pages demo which our client liked. 

Looking forward, I think that my role will be a flexible one and I plan to work with my team to execute a clean and enjoyable look to our website that we and our client will be proud of. I also plan to use any extra time to help out with whatever is needed following my main two goals of executing the website to Azure and designing our pages. I believe that most of this time will be left toward the front-end javascript / AJAX for the implementation of the annual report page. 

While there have been stressful aspects thus far in the project, I have felt that overall all of my teammates and our client have been extremely enjoyable to work with. I look forward to the work left with all of them and plan to be as helpful as I can with the time left.
