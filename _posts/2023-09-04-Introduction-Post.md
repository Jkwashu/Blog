In my setup experience for this blog I struggled a lot with issues during the installation process. Installing ruby took a lot of time and patience diagnosing each new issue that occured, however I feel as though I learned alot of new and useful information through using the terminal and diagnosing some issues on my own. Learning to visit a 'Http' and not 'Https' was another problem that took a little getting used to, but overall I feel as though I understand the concepts and content of this lab more than I would if I had not encountered those issues. Setup and running my own blog is something that I have been looking forward to since starting this class and I look forward to the future with it!
