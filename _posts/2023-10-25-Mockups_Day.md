Hey everyone! This post is an update for the final project of CSCI-340. Over the past few weeks my peers and I have been assigned groups in which we will be working with a client to build a functioning database and website using ASP.Net, Razor Pages, and Azure for website hosting. In this project I have been assigned partners Johannes Mayhofer, Hayden Moussa, and Justin Grubbs and we will be working with our client at the Faulkner County Juvenile court.

A few weeks ago we had our first meeting with our client that went very well, in which she explained to us how she would like to have an improved way to compile and create a annual report for the citizens of Faulkner County. This report would contain things like graphs and statistics of how the current things are looking in regard to all the juveniles that have been detained, arrested, or incarcerated. So, our job would be to have this annual report be able to be created and loaded on to the website.

My role in this is to specifically deal with working on the front-end Javascript / AJAX and to work a bit with my partner Hayden Moussa to design and work on some of front-end HTML / CSS. Over the past week we have continued our work by creating a Moqup of what we expect the design and functionality of our website to be like. In our meeting together discussing what the website should do I took a leading role in the design element of what the website would look like and how the pages should be set up on razor pages.

In the future I plan to help continue with any front-end duties, and assist Hayden with any issues regarding the HTML and CSS while I work on the Javascript / AJAX.
