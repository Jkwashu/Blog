Well thats a wrap on another week here at Disco Tray Studios! This was an interesting week and one where me and my teammates have been able to spend a lot of time looking over the app for more minor fixes, inconsistencies, font differences, and thematic changes to make. Which in short means we have gotten to see the hard work we have put in pay off for a lot of issues! The app is more polished than ever now and with some more polish and getting the last few issues sorted out we can begin to figure out what is next!

I spent some time over the weekend this week figuring out what to work on, what colten had improved, and what exactly to do in the meantime until I have the go-ahead on adding more sites and images for the app. After some discussion with my group I spent a majority of my week on a particular few issues. Firstly, I worked on getting the 'gallery' back to working displaying all of the images, which with a little reading through the code wasn't too bad of a fix. Next I moved on to working on building the logout system for the app!

In building the logout system I didn't have too much of an issue, but upon creating the initial version I realized that the basic google forms purple felt odd for the app. So I worked a bit on getting a formal profile page set up and am in the process of doing the same for the log in screen. Working through the app and keeping a consistent theme has helped the app feel cohesive and flow much better than having one off changes or inconsistencies. The final thing I did was finish up a working profile section the user can click on to reset their password in the app, which also shares the consistent theme with fonts and colors as the rest of the app.

I feel like this was a good wrap up week on several small errors and minor fixes that had been lingering and it helped to clean them up and see a more polished final product. As always thanks to anyone out there for listening, and I will see you all again very soon to update you on my next weeks work!
